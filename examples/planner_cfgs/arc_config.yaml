# Configuration file for ARC (Adaptive Robot Coordination)
# Based on "Adaptive Robot Coordination: A Subproblem-Based Approach for
# Hybrid Multi-Robot Motion Planning" by Solis et al., IEEE RA-L 2024
#
# ARC uses a hierarchical approach to resolve conflicts between robot paths:
# 1. Compute initial decoupled paths (fast but may have collisions)
# 2. Find conflicts and create local subproblems
# 3. Solve subproblems using a 3-level hierarchy:
#    - Level 1: Prioritized Query (waiting strategies, fastest)
#    - Level 2: Decoupled PRM (sequential planning, medium speed)
#    - Level 3: Composite PRM (coupled planning, most powerful)

# ==============================================================================
# Basic Planning Parameters
# ==============================================================================

# Goal distance threshold - robots must reach within this distance of their goals
goal_threshold: 0.5

# ==============================================================================
# Subproblem Configuration
# ==============================================================================

# Initial time window size (timesteps before/after conflict)
# When a conflict is detected, ARC creates a subproblem covering
# [conflict_time - initial_time_window, conflict_time + initial_time_window]
initial_time_window: 10

# Time window expansion step (timesteps to add each expansion)
# If solving fails, the time window is expanded by this amount
time_window_expansion_step: 5

# Maximum number of subproblem expansions
# Limits how many times a subproblem can be expanded before giving up
max_subproblem_expansions: 5

# Spatial expansion factor for environment bounds
# When expanding spatially, multiply bounds by this factor
spatial_expansion_factor: 1.5

# ==============================================================================
# Algorithm 2: Hierarchical Solving Method Timeouts
# ==============================================================================

# Level 1: Prioritized Query timeout (seconds)
# Fast method using waiting strategies, only works for 2-robot conflicts
prioritized_query_timeout: 1.0

# Level 2: Decoupled PRM timeout (seconds)
# Medium-speed method using sequential prioritized planning
decoupled_prm_timeout: 5.0

# Level 3: Composite PRM timeout (seconds)
# Most powerful method using coupled planning in composite space
composite_prm_timeout: 10.0

# ==============================================================================
# Path Discretization
# ==============================================================================

# Number of states to interpolate between waypoints for collision checking
# Higher values = more accurate collision detection but slower
# Lower values = faster but may miss collisions
states_per_check: 10

# ==============================================================================
# Termination Criteria
# ==============================================================================

# Maximum number of conflicts to resolve before giving up
# Prevents infinite loops in pathological cases
max_conflicts_resolved: 100
