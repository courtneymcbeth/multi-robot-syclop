# Configuration file for decoupled_rrt (Prioritized Planning)
# This planner uses a decoupled approach where robots are assigned priorities
# and planned sequentially. Lower priority robots avoid higher priority robots
# by treating them as dynamic obstacles.

# Goal distance threshold - robots must reach within this distance of their goals
goal_threshold: 0.5

# Minimum control duration (number of propagation steps)
min_control_duration: 1

# Maximum control duration (number of propagation steps)
max_control_duration: 10

# Propagation step size (time step for state propagation)
propagation_step_size: 0.1
