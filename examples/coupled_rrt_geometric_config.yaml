# Configuration for Coupled RRT planner - Geometric Mode
# This mode uses geometric RRT planning (no dynamics constraints)

# Time limit for planning (seconds)
time_limit: 60.0

# Goal threshold distance
goal_threshold: 0.5

# Random seed (-1 for random)
seed: 42

# Use geometric planning (no dynamics, faster but paths may not be dynamically feasible)
use_geometric: true

# Note: min_control_duration and max_control_duration are ignored in geometric mode
