# Configuration for Coupled RRT planner - Kinodynamic Mode (Default)
# This mode uses kinodynamic RRT planning with full dynamics integration

# Time limit for planning (seconds)
time_limit: 60.0

# Goal threshold distance
goal_threshold: 0.5

# Control duration range (number of propagation steps)
min_control_duration: 1
max_control_duration: 10

# Random seed (-1 for random)
seed: 42

# Use geometric planning (default: false for kinodynamic)
use_geometric: false
