# Multi-Robot SyCLoP Configuration with LARGE Regions for Coordination
#
# For robots to pass each other in composite space, regions need to be
# large enough for robots to maneuver around each other.
#
# Environment: 10x10
# Robot radius: 0.5 → diameter: 1.0
# Required region size for side-by-side: > 2.0 (2 diameters)
# This config uses 4x4 grid → 2.5x2.5 regions (LARGE ENOUGH)

goal_epsilon: 0.5

# Grid resolution: 4x4 = 16 regions, each 2.5x2.5
# This is large enough for 2 robots to pass each other
grid_resolution: 4

# Increase expansions since we have fewer regions
num_region_expansions: 50
num_tree_selections: 1
prob_shortest_path: 0.95
